### Meeting Minutes

**Cardano Atlantic Council Meeting**

**Date:** February 14, 2025 18:00 UTC

**Attendees:** 
- Beatrice Anihiri
- Thiago Nunes
- Adam Dean
- Mike Hornan
- Richard McCracken

**Purpose:** 
- [x] New GA to lower taxes from 20% to 10%. 
- [x] Budget proposal considerations. 

**Meeting Points:**

1. **New GA to change TAU from 0.2 to 0.1**

> Two constitutions exist at the same time while the governance action to change the TAU parameter is present. If the GA passes both constitutions there is not a problem. If the GA fails one or the other constitution there may be a dilemma depending on which constitution the GA is evaluated against.

 - Does the TAU GA pass both the Interim and BA Constitutions?
 - Argument to wait: Deconflict by waiting until ratification of the BA Constitution replaces the Interim constitution. BA ratification or expire date is March 5th.
 - Argument to not wait: There appears to need to wait for ratification of the BA. Each current and new proposal can be weighed on their own merits and given attention FIFO.
 - Additional considerations: Even though we are under Interim currently, does the passing of the BA Constitution change the outcome of a Yes or No vote toward the TAU GA.
 - Further evaluation is required and will be communicated async.

2. **Off chain budget published by Intersect.**
> Section 2 discussion here applies to DREPs and CC compensation for operating costs only, and whether or not it is permission-less.
n alternate procedures in case of missing members during a short notice emergency.
 - Does the fact that <if> KYC and a contract is required to get funding through a budget, does a budget requiring KYC make the budget unconstitutional?
 - CAC would have to see in writing any underlying contracts that required to be signed  for payment by Intersect or any withdrawing GA entity before deciding the constitutionality of a budget. This adds extra complexity and overhead.
 - Need to ask Intersect (and any withdraw GA proposing entity) to make public any contracts required to get funding from that entity. This introduces greater transparency into the process.
- What is the impact of requiring membership and paying membership fees in the context of an entity requesting funds via the budget process?

3. **Already cast Yes vote on the Constitution**
 - No evidence has become apparent that we would need to change our current Yes for the proposed GA action. CAC members present concur to keep the Yes vote.

**Action Items:**
1. Analyze both constitutions agains the TAU GA for next weekâ€™s meeting.
2. Ask Intersect to make public any contracts that require a DREP or CC member to sign in order to receive compensation.

**Meeting Adjourned:**
The meeting concluded with agreement on the action items and tentatively the next meeting date for February 21, 2025
