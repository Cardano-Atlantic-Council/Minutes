### Meeting Minutes

**Cardano Atlantic Council Meeting**

**Date:** January 31, 2025 18:00 UTC

**Attendees:** 
- Beatrice Anihiri
- Adam Dean
- Mike Hornan
- Jenny Brito
- Richard McCracken
- Thiago Nunes

**Purpose:** 
A New Constitution GA has been submitted on chain. The main discussion focused how to make a decision on whether or not this Constitution can receive a Yes vote based on the Interim Constitution.

**Meeting Points:**

1. **Considerations for a Yes vote**
 - Is the on-chain submitted version the same as the BA signed off-chain version.
     - Does the hash match?
 - Does the new on-chain constitution meet the requirements of the Interim Constitution?
 - Is there sufficient evidence that the new constitution was socialized?
> There was a very extensive level of effort socializing this document to the community over a long period of time. There appears to be community transparency on the communication, and transparency the crafting of the new constitution.
 - Does the community, DReps, Ada Holders, SPOs and Stake Holders view this new constitution with consent?
>  The DReps are sufficiently knowledgeable and empowered to approve or disapprove the new constitution.
 - Is this Interim Preamble met
>  Per the Interim pre-amble “All members of the Cardano community are expected to abide by this Interim Constitution, and are entitled to participate in its governance processes, including completing a Final Constitution to be ratified by Ada holders”

- Was there a significant amount of community participation *and* community inputs were incorperated?
 - This document is not perfect, but it does have a highly significant amount of community input even if some people think there were not enough inputs.

2. **Considerations for a No vote**
 - If the hash of the text does not match
 - Ada Holders cannot submit alternate constitutions or edited versions unless they use the CLI.
 - Does the criteria in the Interim Constitution allow for a Yes vote.
 - A constitutional convention is not required to determine a Yes or No vote on any new constitution or modifications to an approved constitution.
 
3. **Additional Considerations**
 - Do the Ada Holders have sufficient resources to modify or amend the new constitution if it is ratified?
 - Article 1 - Section 1: Through adopting a constitution, the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem shall establish a robust governance framework, ensuring that decisions are made in the best interest of the Cardano community.
 - Can the committe use a previous document to determine if a new document is valid since any change replaces the previous document, *eg: Can you pick a new King because the last King gave us permission to do so?* [ ICC const vs BA const ]

**Competing and Mutually Exclusive Proposals**
 - What is our decision making process when competing and/or mutually exclusive proposals are present at the same time?
1. Cardanon Atlantic will analyze each proposal on its individual merits.
2. One or more proposals may be constitutional or not constitutional at the same time. 
3. The decision ultimately falls on the DReps and Ada Holders to decide which proposals win or lose.

**Operating Costs and Budget**
 - Review of a proposed, standalone budget for CAC operations through 2025
 - Eliminate the need for a contract with any third party to cover costs or expenses.
 - CAC administrate our own budget via smart contract.
1. The smart contract would be the administrator of the funds.
2. The smart contract can only disburse funds to a CAC multi-sig periodically, or return funds to the Treasury.
3. For the purpose of core responsibility time expended, cost of submitting votes, any incurred legal fees, HW/SW support, and event support and coordination if deemed necessary or important.

**Tabled**
 - How to make decisions when an emergency situation is present? We will discuss async until next meeting.

**Action Items:**
1. Wait one epoch to allow community discussions and DReps to evaluate receptiveness while preparing for next meeting temperature check.
2. Review draft internal budget considering actual costs and time expended directly on CC related responsibilities and required activities. Core and complimentary.

**Meeting Adjourned:**
The meeting concluded with agreement on the action items and the next meeting set for February 7, 2025.
