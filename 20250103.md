### Meeting Minutes

**Cardano Atlantic Council Meeting**

**Date:** January 3, 2025 18:00 UTC

**Attendees:** 
- Beatrice Anihiri
- Tiago Nunes
- Jenny Brito
- Mike Hornan
- Adam Dean
- Richard McCracken

**Purpose:** 
Plomin Hard Fork Readiness, Status, Decision Making. The HF GA was deployed on main net in December and expires January 24th.

**Meeting Points:**

1. **Readiness of SPOs and Infrastructure**
 - Node: Testing on Pre-prod indicates performance enhancements may be needed.
 - CAC vote casting estimated to be January 17-19 time frame.
 - Exchange Readiness by Ada stake, and by block producers.
 - We are currently at 79% blocks being made with version 10.1.X
 - We can execute the hard fork on 10.1.3
 - Will any performance enhancements be compatible with 10.1.3 or earlier, or what % block producers will be required?
 - Any update to a new node version will require testing on Sancho/Preprod.
 - Defer decision to next meeting: we must get inputs from TSC and HFWG the week Jan 6-9 for the Jan 10 meeting to get their inputs on readiness. (CAC retains sovereign decision making on the Plomin Hard Fork Yes/No/Abstain vote cast.)

2. **What are the consequences of voting Yes or No**
 - If No, we cannot get the constitution approved by the January 31, 2025 deadline defined in the Interim Constitution. Technically there is no functional impact. On paper we continue using the Interim Constitution until a Draft Constitution is approved on chain.
 - If Yes, some dapps or libraries may not meet the deadline for hard fork activation, which can have knock on effects. Monitor key infrastructure such as Ogmios.
 
3. **Critical decions points**
 - Are libraries ready? (TBD)
 - Are dependencies ready? (TBD)
 - Are DEXs / dapps ready? (TBD)
 - Are SPO nodes % ready? (almost Yes)
 - Has enough SPO stake voted Yes? (TBD)
 - Are there enough DReps? (Yes)

4. **Current Decision State**
 - Current decision state is a No until more information is available and a higher state of readiness achieved by January 23rd decision deadline, leading in the direction of a Yes vote.
 - Target decision date is January 17th, no later than January 23rd. Can change vote if necessary.

**Action Items:**
1. Check with TSC and HFWG the week of Jan 6-9.
2. All members check status of the monitoring tools.
3. Consider developer feedback.

**Postponed** Get inputs and sentiment on net-change-limit of 350 million Ada  and budget details (Budget covers Jan 1 - Dec 31 time frame)

**Meeting Adjourned:**
The meeting concluded with agreement on the action items and tentively the next meeting on January 10th.
