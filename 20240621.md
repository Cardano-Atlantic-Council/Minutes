# Meeting Minutes

**Cardano Atlantic Council Meeting**

**Date:** June 21, 2024 - 16:00 UTC

## **Attendees:** 
- Adam Dean
- Beatrice Anihiri
- Jenny Brito
- Richard McCracken
- Thiago Nunes

## **Purpose:** 
To discuss and decide on the best method for creating multisig keys for the team, ensuring a simple and secure way to post single on-chain votes.

## **Discussion Points:**

1. **First Method: Using an Orchestrator**
   - **Description:** 
     - This method allows 3 out of 6 members on-chain to have the ability to make modifications to the on-chain signing. (This is not the 4 of 6 voter threshold for casting on chain CC decisions)
     - Provides redundancy in case of the loss of one group member.
   - **Advantages:** 
     - Provides redundancy and continuity.
     - Prevents unauthorized changes without group concurrence.

2. **Second Method: Single Member Modification**
   - **Description:**
     - Only one member account can modify the on-chain multisig.
     - The secret key is shared with at least one other member for backup.
   - **Drawbacks:** 
     - Potential for unauthorized changes.
     - The person making the change would not be uniquely identifiable.

3. **Pros and Cons Analysis:**
   - Detailed discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of each method.
   - Open to further suggestions as analysis continues.

4. **Key Storage Techniques:**
   - Discussed various key storage techniques, devices, and security measures.
   - Aim to include these in best practices once a method is determined.

5. **Ongoing Efforts:**
   - Discussion on the continuing efforts required considering the Cardano Atlantic Council is elected.
   - Emphasis on maintaining the security and integrity of the group by ensuring new members cannot be anonymous.

## **Action Items:**

1. **Investigate Multisig Methods:**
   - Continue investigating which of the two methods is best for the group to maintain maximum security, ease of use, and flexibility.

2. **Complete GitHub Administrative Tasks:**
   - Pull request to be completed.

3. **Create Shared Email Account:**
   - Set up a reliable and quality email account for shared access and information forwarding.

4. **Modify the Charter:**
   - Make minor modifications to the charter according to decisions made during the meeting.

5. **Schedule Next Meeting:**
   - Plan to schedule the next meeting for the week of June 24.
