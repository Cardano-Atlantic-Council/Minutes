### Meeting Minutes

**Cardano Atlantic Council Meeting**

**Date:** Decenber 20, 2024 18:00 UTC

**Attendees:** 
- Beatrice Anihiri
- Tiago Nunes
- Jenny Brito
- Mike Hornan
- Adam Dean
- Richard McCracken

**Purpose:** 
Discussion of the Hard Fork proposal, estimated to be deployed shortly.

**Meeting Points:**

1. **What criteria need to met to make a decision one way or another on the Hard Fork.**
 - Traditionally we had an ecosystem readiness chart from the Hard Fork Working Group and ...
 - Exchange readiness status from CF.
 - Do we have enough delegation to DReps?
 - How much delegation to DReps would we like to see before Hard Forking? Check the status.
 - Intersect Plomin Hard Fork Readiness status page at https://cardanoupgrades.docs.intersectmbo.org/plomin-upgrade/chang-upgrade-2-readiness
 - Draft constitution on-chain by January 25thâ€¦ does not specify ratification date.


2. **Pay attention the Hard Fork Working Group Recommendations**
 
3. **We are under the Interim Constitution until the BA Constitution is ratified by DReps.**

4. **Monitor specifically for the Hard Fork:**
 - Percent SPOs updated to 10.1.3 required for the hard fork.
 - Percent SPOs vote required for the Hard Fork.
 - Exchanges at 80% based on Ada amount.

5. **DRep delegations**
 - Before and after the hard fork. After the hard fork the Ada stakers will be required to delegate in order to withdraw rewards 
 - Cardano wallets are considering adopting auto abstain as a default if people had not yet picked a DRep.

6. **Current State**
 - Analyzed the current amount of DRep and SPO voting on Adastat, compared to how much could vote. We are currently at about 10% of staked Ada is actually participating in governance by actively delegating to a voting DRep (not auto abstain) and active SPO participation, which previously was not required. SPO participation will be required to execute the hard fork.
 - Initial estimate indicates the CC - CAC should probably wait until about the 5th epoch to cast the vote, to allow sufficient time for SPOs and DReps time to vote - to establish that the blockchain actors are actually ready for the hard fork. This is a monitoring data point.

7. **At what point are we comfortable making a decision.**

**Action Items:**

1. Read and analyze the HF proposal when it is deployed.
2. All members check status of the monitoring tools.
3. Continue to collect data on anticipated budget related info that is published. Draft or otherwise.

**Meeting Adjourned:**
The meeting concluded with agreement on the action items and tentively a next meeting. Next meeting discussion to look at the net-change-limit of 350 million Ada  and budget details between Jan 1 - Dec 31 time frame. The interim constitution does not specify an amount but simply specifies that a budget must be passed before withdrawals can be made.
