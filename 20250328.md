**Date:** March 28, 2025 19:00 UTC

**Attendees:**

- Adam Dean
- Jenny Brito
- Richard McCracken

**Purpose:** 
1. Discussion on NCL #1 and NCL#2 - two Net Change Limit proposals for 2025 that are both currently on-chain.

**Meeting Points:**
1. **Two NCLs at present**
>What are we going to do if both of the NCL proposals end up passing, which one is in effect for the year 2025?

 - The first NCL proposal gets overwritten by the new NCL proposal.
 - Article 3 section 3, and appendix 1 section 3 do not clearly define the current circumstance.
 - The 350 million overwrites the 300 million for 2025 if subsequently approved by DReps.
 - The existing one still has 250 million Ada for 2026, what becomes of that if approved?
 - Treat as LIFO, last in first out. The most recently approved INFO NCL by DReps stands. Previous NCL INFO is overwritten entirely.
 - EG: The new proposal kicks out the NCL for 2026 from the first NCL proposal.

>Result: The most recently passed NCL is the only NCL in effect.

**Action Items:**
1. Complete rationale for NCL #1 as unconstitutional.
