## **Purpose:** 
- Group and individual communicaitons with other ICC teams. 
- Continuted discussion of setting up a legal entity.
- New Governance Action to discuss

## **Discussion Points:**

1. **Procedural discussion**

- Communications on group commitments to each member and to other ICC teams. Using tact and diplomacy for constructive dialogue even when disagreement is at play.

- Achieving agreement on public communications, balanced with the idea itâ€™s OK to voice strong opinions from an individual perspective to speak for yourself to get it out there. Help find common ground even if passionate about a certain position.

2. **Legal**
- Budgeting and working with Intersect.
- Each team member participate as an individual LLC.
- The LLC would be the entity that receives reimbursements for travel costs and other logistics.
- The point of the LLC is to protect individual members from liabilities and voting repercussions and establish a place of jurisdiction in the case of disputes.

3. **Info Governance Action to raise the K parameter**
- initial discussions
- Constitutional or Abstain is initial assessment. Unconstitutional is not likely.
- Rational that it is sentiment based and not asking for an action. Although not an actual parameter chiange, it lacks information to justify an increase or change to a parameter.

## **Action Items:**

1. Need to answer if we are ok as a group to use individual LLCs for each individual person.
2. Make final decision to signing contracts individually as individuals, or as a group.
3. Continue K parameter INFO conversation async. Further evaluation required.

## **Meeting Adjourned:**
The meeting concluded with agreement on the action items and the schedule for the next meeting.
