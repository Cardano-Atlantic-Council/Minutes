- Dissent to a Constitutional or Abstain vote. When CAC, as an ICC member, votes in any way on a proposal, it does not represent a commitment from CAC that each person agrees or disagrees with the content of the proposal, nor to abide or pledge to it. It simply means that the proposal is constitutional or not as written.
