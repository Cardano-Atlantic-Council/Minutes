- Thiago Nunes
- Adam Dean
- Mike Hornan
- Jenny Brito
- Richard McCracken

**Purpose:** 
1. Discuss the Cardano Vision 2025 GA INFO proposal 

**Meeting Points:**

1. **Positions for a No vote of Unconstitutional**
 - The roadmap is off-chain, not on chain record except for the proposal
 - Versioning control proplems are present, since the GA document asks for input is subject to changes to the off-chain roadmap. The question becomes what version of the off chain document is being voted on?

2. **Positions for an Abstain vote due to proposal ambiguitey or conflicts**
 - Ambiguity: What is being asked in the GA, is it asking for inputs or asking for approval? Imprecise language leans team members toward Abstain.

3. **Positions for a Yes vote of Constitutional**
 - The GA does not explicitily violate the constitution requiring a No vote, therefore a team member is inlcined to cast a Yes vote.

4. Vote results:
 - As various opinions were presented the vote positions changed by a few members.
 - 4 Abstain, 1 Constitutional, 1 Unconstitutional was the end result.
 - Team members agreed that Abstain is acceptable to go on chain.

**Action Items:**
1. Draft and submit all positions for a Yes, Abstain, and No vote.
2. Prepare votes for team members.
3. Cast on-chain vote by March 20.

**Meeting Adjourned:**
The meeting concluded with agreement on the action items and tentatively the next meeting date.
