### Meeting Minutes

**Cardano Atlantic Council Meeting**

**Date:** January 3, 2025 18:00 UTC

**Attendees:** 
- Beatrice Anihiri
- Adam Dean
- Tiago Nunes
- Jenny Brito
- Richard McCracken

**Purpose:** 
Plomin Hard Fork Readiness, Status, and Decision Making considering the 10.1.4 node release, protocol version 10.2.

**Meeting Points:**

1. **Readiness of SPOs and Infrastructure**
- What % upgrade to 10.1.4 do we expect to see prior to voting Yes on the Plomin Hard Fork?
- [x] SMEs recommend 85%, one SME recommend 90%
- [x] Current number of SPOs on 10.1.4 by stake weight is 45%
- [x] Current number of SPOs on 9.1 or earlier is 9%
- What are the risks and tradeoffs of doing the Hard Fork and not doing the hard fork?
- *What are the risks involved even if 85% of SPOs upgrade to 10.1.4 and the hard fork is executed?*
- [x] Testing in progress on Sancho Net to determine node behavior when undesirable transactions are present.
- At what % threshold the only threat to the network is SPOs who failed to upgrade past 10.1.3

2. **Other consideration to achieve a Yes vote**
- We are awaiting for a recommendation from the TSC and Security group conducting analysis to set a minimum % safety threshold. We will consider it, but not necessarily follow it.
- Our current minimum is 85% until further information is available.
- The Cardano Atlantic Council must be as, or more, strict than the wording of Interim Constitution of HARDFORK-04a (x) At least 85% of stake pools by active stake should have upgraded to a Cardano Blockchain node version that is capable of processing the rules associated with the new protocol version due to the fact that both 10.1.3 and 10.1.4 are both capable of transiting the hard fork.
- Many dapps have signaled readiness.
 
3. **Critical decions points**
 - Are dependencies ready? (Yes)
 - Are DEXs / dapps ready? (TBD)
 - Are SPO nodes % ready on 10.1.4? (No)
 - Has enough SPO stake voted Yes? (TBD)
 - Are there enough DReps? (Yes)

4. **Current Decision State**
- Current decision state is a No until more information is available and a higher state of readiness achieved by January 23rd decision deadline, leading in the direction of a Yes vote.
- Target decision date is January 17th, action expires on January 24th.
- Be prepared to cast votes promply if the threshold for a Yes is very tight around January 21-22.

**Action Items:**
1. Tally up how much % Ada on exchanges are in a Ready state.
2. Continue to check monitoring tools.
3. Double check with dapp devs/founders.

**Meeting Adjourned:**
The meeting concluded with agreement on the action items and tentively the next meeting on January 17th.
