3. Changes to the charter
4. Who on CAC is running for re-election?

**Meeting Points:**

1. **Tax cut from 20% to 10% constitutionality Yes/No discussion.**
 - Points for a Yes vote
> Upon review of the proposal and constitution many team members view there is no wording that causes the proposal to be deemed unconstitutional.

 - Points for a No vote
>The proposal relies heavily on assumptions rather than direct data, making economic projections such as a 12.5 percent increase in staking rewards without referencing any modeling, empirical data, or prior studies to substantiate them. While it asserts constitutional alignment, it fails to address whether the absence of supporting evidence, including economic analysis or stakeholder discussions, could render the governance action unconstitutional. Additionally, no off-chain documentation or proof of prior socialization has been provided to support these claims, raising concerns about the transparency and legitimacy of the proposal.

>A separate document will be provided to address specific details on Clarity, Eviddence, Logical Reasoning, Considerations, Transparency, Risk Assessment and Verification.

 - Debate about the tax cut impacts among the community is being observed on various social media.
 - Further discussion is required on the tax cut 20% to 10%, deadline for decision is March 6.

2. **Setting the P0, P1, P2 tags - team inputs**
