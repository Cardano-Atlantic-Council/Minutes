### Meeting Minutes

**Cardano Atlantic Council Meeting**

**Date:** November 15, 2024 18:00 UTC

**Attendees:** 
- Mike Hornan
- Adam Dean
- Beatrice Anihiri
- Jenny Brito
- Richard McCracken
- Tiago Nunes

**Purpose:** 
To discuss and tentatively decide on the corrected Plutus V3 cost model GA on Cardano mainnet.

**Meeting Points:**

1. ** Preliminary**
 - Prior to the meeting team members collected a body of evidence to show SME concurrence with the Pv3 cost model changes.
 - Reviewed the parameter change GA.

2. **Discussion our own decision making proces**
 - To decide if this GA is constitutional.
 - Is there enough SME evidence they have proposed a GA they need given the limited skill set of the ICC members?
 - Does the CAC have enough confidence to vote **YES** based on public evidence and discussions?
 - Is there any SME pushback or issues identified?
 - Is there any reason for a **NO** vote?

3. Searched publicly on the forum and Github for any opposing SME information such as a cost model parameter being too high or too low.

4. **GA Discussions**
 - There is plenty of time between the time these parameters are approved on Pre-view and Pre-Prod and the Chang +1 HF on main net. This should provide sufficient time that if any of the values are problematic or a new issue is discovered, the values can be corrected before the Chang+1 HF on Cardano main net.
 - Considerations: Guardrail script cannot check this specific cost model since there are new values that the guardrail script is not aware of.
 - Raw JSON data on cexplorer: https://cexplorer.io/governance/activity
 - CIPs from SMEs

5. **Sanity Checks**
 - Adam performed a diff check that the parameters proposed in the GA to be modified match 100% with described intended changes.
 - Mike gave a description of the use of CPU and memory units and other changes, including the benchmarking given the GA rationale.
 - Rick requested any SME feedback on X in case there are any issues with the cost model changes in the GA.
 - Out of scope question: What are the negative Plutus V3 cost model values? They already exist are not part of the GA but just curious. This was related to the use of the words “should” and “must” in the constitution when adjusting parameters.

6. **Tentative Consensus**
 - Group sees this as a Yes vote with sufficient evidence and data from SMEs.

7. Several CAC members preparing for travel to Southe America and the Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires.

8. **Ongoing Legal Entity Discussions**
 - Jenny provided information about forming an MBO to include the services provided by a 3rd party and associated costs.

**Action Items:**

1. Cross reference and double check the links in this document and the actual on chain parameter change to the documents published by Subject Matter Experts
2. Mike is checking with Sam Leathers with a few questions on the cost model, for clarification and prudence.
3. Wrap up any individual research early next week and provide results async via Telegram.
4. Construct the Yes early next week, cast votes before November 22.

**Meeting Adjourned:**
The meeting concluded with agreement on the action items and tentively a next meeting considering travel requirements.
