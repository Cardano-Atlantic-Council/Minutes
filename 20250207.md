3. **Scenarios: Must vote by the end of an epoch to stop a catastrophic change from executing**
 - Must vote to counter an attack by bad actor. (DDoS, economic attack).
 - Must vote during a parameter change to put it back to it's original value before it executes.
> What happens if a vote has to occur during a long lived network partition
> Who do we consider a valid source for emergency notification?

5. **Operating costs and compensation for committee work**
 - What is the actual value of time PER HOUR and level effort to operate as a constitutional committee member?
> Example: A typical average financial analyst in the United States is about $40/hour.
 - What activities count as "must have" to perform the required duties of ICC?
 - What activities count as important but not absolutely necessary?
 - How much time is required for socialization of issues, community feedback, and training?
 - What is an appropriate amount to compensate reasonably without turning a withdrawal request into a grift?
 - Cost of hardware, auditing, and legal requirements tallied in the operating budget.
> Example calculation: 5 to 10 hours per week per person, x 6 people, at about $40 per hour for typical US financial analyst pay. 5 hours per week under normal conditions and possibly 10 hours per week if a large number of proposals are active in parallel.
 - CAC will not accept funds from Intersect, Pragma, or other entities. We will attempt to get the funding by submitting our own budget and requesting an independent treasury withdrawal action. 
- When CAC submits an operating budget action we will immediately vote abstain on our own action.

**Action Items:**
1. Construct Yes votes on the Constitution.
2. All members sign - target submit February 12.
