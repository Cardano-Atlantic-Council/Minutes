1. **Setting up a legal entitiy**

- Pros and cons. Appears to be a necessity to some degree, but still questionable.
- Costs for hardware, travel and logistic costs.
- Need to figure out if a non-profit, DAO, , Trust, LLC, etcâ€¦
- more research required, this is not time critical, deadline November 30th to make a decision and begin process.
- locations such as Panama are an option if needed.
- No state tax in Wyoming, PTE, LLC S-corp
- Remote islands may look shady to community members
- Lots of concerns about complexity and legal requirements, hiring a lawyer, paying a fee for an agent.
- This is a volunteer job but what happens if it transitions into a paid compensation?
- Mercury Bank, Kraken accounts, or any tax accounting requirements possibly needed adds complexity (depending on location)
- Receive and store money for costs in Ada, manage balances and send out in Ada, use a multi-sig smart contract is an option.
- Another option is individual invoices for required costs, which is simpler.
