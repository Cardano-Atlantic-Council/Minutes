**Purpose:** 
Plomin Hard Fork Readiness, Status, and Decision Making considering the 10.1.4 node release, protocol version 10.2.

**Meeting Points:**

1. **Readiness of SPOs and Infrastructure**
 - 86% upgrade to 10.1.4 by block production the past 12 HRS.
 - SMEs recommend 85%.
 - Risks are sufficiently minimized. 
 - There is a low % threshold remaining that SPOs who failed to upgrade nodes become problematic.

2. **Other consideration to achieve a Yes vote**
 - All thresholds met with a minor consideration of exchange liquidity. Not an ICC requirement, but a good idea to consider the impact on users while motivating exchanges to upgrade.
 - Reviewed status against the Interim Constitution again.
